# WealthGuard-RegBI-Auditor
This tool uses a "Dual-AI" architecture. One AI acts as the "Advisor" (the one we are testing), and the second AI acts as the Compliance Officer (the Auditor).
# 🛡️ WealthGuard: Reg-BI AI Auditor
**Automated Fiduciary Oversight for Financial LLMs**

### 📊 The Problem
As financial institutions deploy AI chatbots to interact with clients, the risk of "Regulatory Drift" increases. AI models often lack the context of **SEC Regulation Best Interest (Reg-BI)**, leading to unsuitable high-risk recommendations for conservative investors.

### 🎯 The Solution
WealthGuard is a "Compliance-as-Code" tool that uses a secondary LLM to act as a **Virtual Compliance Officer**. It audits advisor outputs in real-time against:
* **FINRA Suitability Standards**
* **SEC Reg-BI Care Obligations**
* **Fiduciary Risk Frameworks**

### 🛠️ Key Technical Features
* **Context-Aware Auditing:** Ingests complex JSON client profiles (Age, Risk, Liquidity).
* **Adversarial Testing:** Specifically designed to catch "hallucinations" in leveraged or illiquid product recommendations.
* **Automated Remediation:** Provides feedback to the primary AI model to correct non-compliant advice.

### 💼 Fiduciary Authority
Developed by a **Series 7 & 63 Licensed Professional**. This tool bridges the gap between modern AI innovation and traditional financial integrity.
